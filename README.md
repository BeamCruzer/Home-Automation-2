# Home Automation 2
This is more simpler and cost effective version of my previous home automation project with almost same design.

## Functionality of the project => 
* The project board can be connected to WiFi and can switch ON/OFF different devices like light, fan (Any 2 devices) through internet. 
* Real time feedback can be seen through android application and web dashboard. The devices can also be switched from there. 
* You can switch the appliances from anywhere in the world through mobile/laptop as the project board is connected to internet. 
* Timing automations can be created to save electricity. For example, turn ON the fan for exactly 1 hour 30 minutes and turn it back OFF after that.

## Specifications of the project => 
* The heart of the project is ESP8266 NODEMCU microcontroller which enables the board with WiFi connectivity. 
* The board sends data to server as a client and the userâ€™s input from mobile/laptop is also transferred to the server and data is interpreted there. After that, data is updated in the board as per the coding. 
* The switching is done by relays which can switch AC loads (upto 10Amps).
* This project will work only with internet connections and has no offline operations.

## Benefits of the project => 
* Compared to my last Home Automation project, it is more compact and efficient with less wiring complexity. 
* The main motive to make this project is to switch ON/OFF fan and lights at night through mobile.
